Authors: @[Tsun Lok](https://github.com/utvompl) and @[Ruichong Liu](https://github.com/ruichongliu)

## Nov. 11| v1.0.0
We developed a web scraper for site armslist.com, as a hackathon project for [Data Dive 17](https://qac.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2017/10/16/wesleyans-2017-datadive-an-exploration-into-activism-through-data-analysis/) at [Wesleyan University](http://www.wesleyan.edu/).
Code was developed in Python 3.6, and we used Beautiful Soup to process HTML content, requests for sending HTTP requests and lxml for html parser.
